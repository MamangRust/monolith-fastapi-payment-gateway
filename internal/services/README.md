## Services

The `services` folder contains the individual monolith that collectively make up the application's architecture. Each service in this folder is dedicated to a specific domain or functionality, designed to operate independently and communicate with other services as needed. This modular structure enhances scalability, maintainability, and fault tolerance of the system.
