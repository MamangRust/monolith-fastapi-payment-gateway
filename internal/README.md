## Internal

The `internal` folder serves as a container for the core components and logic of the application. It typically includes:

1. `services`: Houses the specific monolith responsible for handling different domain functionalities of the application. Each service operates independently, managing its own data and business logic.

2. lib: Contains shared libraries and utilities that are commonly used across multiple services, such as configurations, models, or helper functions. This promotes code reuse and consistency throughout the application.

The `internal` structure is designed to organize the project's `internal` modules, ensuring a clear separation of concerns and facilitating ease of development and maintenance.
